Impact and Results
Matching Accuracy: Improved resume-to-job matching through dynamic keyword extraction and AI analysis, achieving significant user satisfaction in test scenarios.
User Experience: Delivered a responsive, intuitive interface that reduces friction in the job application process.
Scalability: Architected the backend to handle multiple concurrent users with efficient database queries and API responses.
(Note: Replace with specific metrics if available, e.g., "Enhanced matching accuracy by 20% in user testing.")

Future Enhancements
Implement advanced caching mechanisms to improve API response times for larger user bases.
Add support for multi-format resume uploads (e.g., PDF, DOCX) with enhanced parsing libraries.
Integrate real-time job posting scraping from platforms like LinkedIn to expand matching scope.
